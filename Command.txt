first I check the status so git status
git add myFile.txt (this command will add the myfile.txt file)
git status

Question 4 :
I add the folder Info in the git.
git add Info
git status

Question 5:
git config user.name 
git config user.name "FeriPatel_INFO" //this command will change the name
git config user.name 

the things which I commit "I add some folder and subfolder and also files and then i addedd all the codes in the command.txt file."

Question 6 : 
I update myFile.txt with course name and code and then I did git status in git bash and I change something and because of that it comes in the red thing because I didn't add the file again.

I learned to add the files, folders, add the codes in the files, and then add to the git bash. In the git bash, I learned some code like git add, git status, git username for change the username.
